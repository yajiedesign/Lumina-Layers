Inspiration and Technical Statements

### Acknowledgements to Pioneers

This project owes its existence to the open sharing of the following technologies:

- **HueForge** - The first tool to introduce optical color mixing to the FDM community, demonstrating that layering transparent materials can achieve rich colors through light transmission.

- **AutoForge** - An automated color matching workflow, making multi-material color printing easy to use.

- **CMYK Printing Theory** - A layer-by-layer transmission adaptation of the classic subtractive color model in 3D printing.

### Technical Differentiation and Positioning

Traditional tools rely on theoretical calculations (such as TD1/TD0 transmission distance values), but these parameters are highly susceptible to failure due to various objective factors.

 **Lumina Studio employs an exhaustive search approach:**

1. Print a 1024-color physical calibration board (4 colors x 5 layers, full permutation)

2. Scan the board by photograph and extract the actual RGB data

3. Create a "LUT" (Learning Unknown Test Table)

4. Use a nearest neighbor algorithm for matching (similar to the matching in Bambulab's keychain generator).

### Prior Art Declaration

The core principle of FDM multilayer overlay was publicly disclosed by software such as HueForge between 2022 and 2023, and is considered **prior art**.

The HueForge authors have also clearly stated that this technology has entered the public domain, and in most countries and regions, if the patent office carefully examines it, a principle patent would certainly be rejected.

The pioneers have chosen to remain open to help the community develop; therefore, this technology is generally **not patentable**.

Lumina Studio will continue to maintain its open-source, collaborative, and non-profit positioning, and we welcome everyone's supervision.
Lumina Studio will continue to operate on an open-source, collaborative, and non-profit basis, and we welcome your feedback.

- This project is an open-source, non-profit project. There will be no bundled sales, and no features will be made into paid features.
- If you or your company wish to support the project's continued development, please contact us. Sponsored products will only be used for software development, testing, and optimization.
- Sponsorship represents support for the project only and does not constitute any commercial binding.
- We reject any sponsorship collaborations that could influence technical decisions or open-source licenses.
Lumina Studio did not refer to any patent applications because such patents usually only contain specifications and the technical code is not disclosed in the short term. Blindly referring to these patents would affect its own development process.

**Special thanks to the HueForge team for their support and understanding of open source!**  **

## Open Ecosystem

### About .npy Calibration Files

All calibration presets (`.npy` files) are **completely free and open**, adhering to the following principles:

- **No Vendor Lock-in:** We have never, currently, and will never force users to use specific consumable brands, nor will we require manufacturers to produce specific "compatible consumables" that meet our requirements. This violates the spirit of open source.

- **Community Collaboration:** We welcome all users, organizations, and consumable manufacturers to submit PRs and synchronize calibration presets. Your printer data can help others.

- No other testing tools are needed; all you need is a 3D printer and a mobile phone.

**Open Data = Democratization of Technology**

Lumina Studio v1.4.1 integrates three major modules into a unified interface:

### 📐 Module 1: Calibration Generator

Generates precision calibration boards to physically test filament mixing.

- **1024-Color Matrix**: Full permutation of 4 base filaments across 5 layers (0.4mm total)
- **Dual Color Modes**: Supports both CMYW (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow/White) and RYBW (Red/Yellow/Blue/White)
- **Face-Down Optimization**: Viewing surface prints directly on the build plate for a smooth finish
- **Solid Backing**: Automatically generates a 1.6mm opaque backing to ensure color consistency and structural rigidity
- **Anti-Overlap Geometry**: Applies 0.02mm micro-shrinkage to voxels to prevent slicer line-width conflicts

### 🎨 Module 2: Color Extractor

Digitizes the physical reality of your printer.

- **Computer Vision**: Perspective warp + lens distortion correction for automatic grid alignment
- **Mode-Aware Alignment**: Corner markers follow the correct color sequence based on your selected mode (CMYW vs RYBW)
- **Digital Twin**: Extracts RGB values from the print and generates a .npy LUT file
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive probe tools allow manual verification/correction of specific color block readings (e.g., removing glare/shadows)

### 💎 Module 3: Image Converter

Converts images into printable 3D models using calibrated data.

- **KD-Tree Color Matching**: Maps image pixels to actual printable colors found in your LUT
- **Live 3D Preview**: Interactive WebGL preview with true matched colors—rotate, zoom, and inspect before printing
- **Keychain Loop Generator**: Automatically adds functional hanging loops with:
  - Smart color detection (matches nearby model colors)
  - Customizable dimensions (width, length, hole diameter)
  - Rectangle base + semicircle top + hollow hole geometry
  - 2D preview shows loop placement
- **Structure Options**: Double-sided (keychain) or Single-sided (relief) modes
- **Smart Background Removal**: Automatic transparency detection with adjustable tolerance
- **Correct 3MF Naming**: Objects are named by color (e.g., "Cyan", "Magenta") instead of "geometry_0" for easy slicer identification

## What's New in v1.4.1 🚀

### Modeling Mode Consolidation

**High-Fidelity Mode Replaces Vector & Woodblock Modes**:

The three modeling modes (Vector/Woodblock/Voxel) have been streamlined into **two unified modes**:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 🎨 **High-Fidelity Mode** | Unified RLE-based mesh generation with K-Means quantization | Logos, photos, portraits, illustrations |
| 🧱 **Pixel Art Mode** | Legacy voxel mesher with blocky aesthetic | Pixel art, 8-bit style graphics |

**Why the change?**
- Vector and Woodblock modes shared 90% of the same code
- High-Fidelity mode combines the best of both: smooth curves + detail preservation
- Simpler UI with fewer confusing options
- Consistent 10 px/mm resolution for all high-quality outputs

### Language Switching

- **🌐 Dynamic Language Toggle**: Click the language button in the top-right corner to switch between Chinese and English
- **Full UI Translation**: All interface elements update instantly without page reload
- **Persistent Settings**: Language preference is maintained during the session

### Other Improvements

- **Code Optimization**: Improved code structure and maintainability
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced inline documentation and comments
- **Stability Improvements**: Minor bug fixes and performance tweaks

## How It Works

### Why Calibration Matters

Theoretical TD values assume:
- Perfectly consistent filament dye concentration
- Identical nozzle temperatures across all materials
- Uniform layer adhesion

In reality, these vary significantly between:
- Different filament brands/batches
- Printer models and nozzle designs
- Environmental humidity and temperature

The LUT-based approach solves this by measuring actual printed colors and matching them via nearest-neighbor search in RGB space.
